## Gradient descent Method for calculate the intercept only
# 1) use the sum of the squared residuals as the Loss function to evaluate how a line fits the data
# 2) take the derivative of the sum of the squared residuals ( we took the derivative of the loss function)
# 3) Then we calculated the derivative when the Intercept = 0 (random value)
# 4) Plug that slope into the Step Size calculation : Step Size = Slope * Learning rate
# 5) Calculated the new intercept , the difference between the old intercept and the Step size 
# 6) Lastly, we plugged the New Intercept into derivative and repeated everything until Step size was close to 

## Gradient descent Method for calculate the intercept and the slope: y = tetha0 + theta1 * x
## where theta0 is the intercept and theta1 the slope
# 1) We want to find the values for the intercept and slope that give us the minimum sum of the squared residuals
# 2) take the derivative of the sum of the squared residuals ( we took the derivative of the loss function)
# - this time we take the derivative with respect to the intercept AND the derivtive with respect to the slope
# - d / d intercept AND d / d slope
# 4) Derivative with repect of the intercept -> The chain rule
